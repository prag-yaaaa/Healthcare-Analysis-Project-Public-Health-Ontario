**Background of the Project**

The Project is all about statistical exploration of Chronic Diseases mainly Hypertension, COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) and Diabetes along with their risk factors mainly in the Ontario region.

The data for this project has been taken from Public Health Ontario Portal. The data is taken from two different sets as first one is Chronic Disease Prevalence Dataset and another is Behavioural Risk Factors Dataset. Under the Chronic Prevalence Dataset, the data for the chronic disease Hypertension. COPD and Diabetes are included. For behavioural Risk factor dataset, data related to Alcohol Consumption, Smoking Rates, Nutrition or Obesity Data and Physical Activity Data is taken. All the data is based on age standardization rates.

Chronic diseases are a leading cause of illness and death in Ontario, accounting for approximately two-thirds of all deaths in 2015. Among these, hypertension, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remain major contributors to the province's healthcare burden. Diabetes alone affected over 1.3 million Ontarians, while COPD saw more than 60,000 new diagnoses in the same year. Although specific hypertension figures were not broken out, it is among the top four chronic conditions responsible for over 500,000 new cases annually. These conditions not only significantly impact quality of life but also contribute to increased hospitalization and healthcare costs.

**Objectives of the Project**

The primary objective of this study is to investigate how chronic diseases—specifically Hypertension, COPD, and Diabetes—interact and co-occur across Ontario. By comparing patterns in hospitalization rates, the study aims to uncover potential correlations and overlaps among these conditions. A second, equally important focus is on understanding how individual behavioral factors—such as smoking, physical inactivity, poor nutrition, and alcohol consumption—are contributing to the rise in hospitalizations. Together, these objectives seek to provide a deeper understanding of both the medical and lifestyle-driven dimensions of chronic disease prevalence, with the goal of supporting more targeted public health strategies in Ontario.

**Analysis and Findings**

Steps Followed

  1. Data Import
  
  2. Data Cleaning
  
  3. Data Preprocessing
  
  4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
  
  5. Statistical Analysis
  
For Statisticl Analysis : Multiple Linear Regression Model, GLM Poisson Model and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Models are used.

Our analysis revealed strong interdependencies between these chronic diseases—especially a significant positive correlation between COPD and Hypertension, and an inverse association between Diabetes and Hypertension.

Behavioral factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity, and physical inactivity showed measurable impacts on disease rates. Notably, smoking and physical inactivity emerged as consistent and significant predictors across all three conditions.

Poisson regression models, better suited for count data, revealed stronger explanatory power and more reliable patterns than standard linear regression, with all key predictors being highly significant.

Finally, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) helped reduce dimensional complexity and confirmed overlapping patterns among the three diseases, suggesting common underlying risk structures and shared public health drivers. Together, these insights underscore the urgent need for integrated, behavior-focused interventions to curb chronic disease burdens in Ontario.
